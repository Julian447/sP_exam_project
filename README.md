**Make sure to include** testing and benchmarking code as well as the sample results, measurements, plots and
conclusions into the report.

## Notes
- **pay attention to safety and performance**
    - avoid copying
    - as much const as possible (within reason)
    - nothing is const by default (https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/const-correctness )

- doesn't have to use multithreading, can also optimize the reactions (i.e. don't subtract then add the same reactant, see last slides)
- for covid-19 example, use at least 10.000
